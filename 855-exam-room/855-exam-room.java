		  Note that "distance" variable is initialized to first appearing seat,
		  why because the distance calculation is based on current seat and the seat before that. 
		  Find the maximum distance and update the seat number accordingly.
		  distance calculation -> (current seat - previous seat )/ 2
		  Update the max distance at each step.
		  New seat number will be ->  previous seat number + max distance 
		  
		  Now, before returning the end result,  check for one more edge case:
		  That is, if the max distance calculated is less than ->  capacity-1-seats.last()
		  
		  Why because -> if last seat number in treeset is far from last position, 
		  then  the largest distance possible is the last position.
